# Granular Plan

## Module: Project Setup & Baseline (Current Session)
- [x] Re-run `tsc --noEmit` and resolve remaining type errors
- [x] Remove remaining version-suffixed imports (`sonner@2.0.3`, `@radix-ui/react-slot@1.1.2`)
- [x] Consolidate shared types in `types/index.ts`
- [x] Update components to use shared types
- [ ] Fix remaining type issues in `CustomerVideoPlayer`:
  - [ ] Resolve `VehicleStatus` enum usage
  - [ ] Fix boolean attribute type issues
  - [ ] Update mock data to match shared types
- [ ] Update `file-structure.md` with any new files
- [ ] Commit baseline working build

## Next Steps
- [ ] Align Prisma schema with TypeScript types
- [ ] Regenerate Prisma Client
- [ ] Set up database connection
- [ ] Implement API routes for data fetching
- [ ] Update components to use real data

## New Conversation Prompt
```
Let's continue working on the Glass Dashboard project. Here's what we need to focus on next:

1. First, let's resolve the remaining TypeScript errors in `CustomerVideoPlayer.tsx`:
   - Fix `VehicleStatus` enum usage in mock data
   - Resolve boolean attribute type issues
   - Ensure mock data matches the shared types

2. Once the TypeScript errors are resolved, we should:
   - Run `tsc --noEmit` to verify no type errors remain
   - Update `file-structure.md` with any new files or changes
   - Create a clean baseline commit

3. For the next phase, we can start working on:
   - Aligning the Prisma schema with our TypeScript types
   - Setting up the database connection
   - Implementing API routes for data fetching

Would you like to start with the remaining TypeScript errors, or would you prefer to focus on a different aspect of the project?
