## 🧭 Instructions to Windsurf

### Step 1: Create the `master-plan.md`
- This file will act as the high-level roadmap.
- It must not be changed after creation unless I explicitly instruct you to.
- It defines the core features and structure of the project.

### Step 2: Generate `granular-plan.md`
- Based strictly on the `master-plan.md`.
- Break each task into actionable, session-level steps.
- Use this to track progress only for the current conversation.
- Update it only at the end of the session by checking off completed tasks.
- Do not modify `master-plan.md` when checking off granular items.

### Step 3: Generate 'file-structure.md'
- include file structure of project
regularly update and/or check before creating the following
--features, components, elements, services, frameworks, databases ect.

Double check contents are updated at the end-of-conversation prompt
Refer to file-structure.md contents at the beginnng-of-conversation prompt when updating plan.md
